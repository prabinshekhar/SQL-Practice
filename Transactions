How to Implement Transactions in SQL?
BEGIN TRANSACTION: Marks the start of an explicit or local transaction.
Syntax: BEGIN TRANSACTION transaction_name;
SET TRANSACTION: Sets properties for the current transaction (e.g., isolation level).
Syntax: SET TRANSACTION [READ WRITE | READ ONLY];
COMMIT: Records all changes since the last COMMIT or ROLLBACK.
Example: Delete records from a table where age = 20 and then COMMIT the changes:
SQL

DELETE FROM Student WHERE AGE = 20;
COMMIT;

ROLLBACK: Reverses changes if any error occurs within a transaction.
Example: Delete records where age = 20 and then ROLLBACK:
SQL

DELETE FROM Student WHERE AGE = 20;
ROLLBACK;
